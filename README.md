   The Apache Beam pipeline reads the match records from the input CSV file, processes them to count the number of matches played by each team, and writes the results to an output CSV file 
   named team_match_counts.csv.
   The output CSV file contains the aggregated results of the number of matches played by each team. Each record in the output file has the following columns:

   TeamName: The name of the football team.
   MatchCount: The total number of matches played by the team (as a home team or away team).
