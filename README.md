2. Apache Beam : Pipeline IO : Input Dataset : fotball_mathes.csv
   The Apache Beam pipeline reads the match records from the input CSV file named football_matches.csv, processes them to count the number of matches played by each team, and writes the 
   results to an output CSV file 
   named team_match_counts.csv.
   The output CSV file contains the aggregated results of the number of matches played by each team. Each record in the output file has the following columns:

   TeamName: The name of the football team.
   MatchCount: The total number of matches played by the team (as a home team or away team).

3. Apache Beam : Pardo Function : Input Dataset: restaurant_orders.csv
   Apache Beam Pipeline: ParDo Transformation
   The Apache Beam pipeline performs a ParDo transformation to process the input dataset. The transformation involves the following steps:

   Read from CSV: The pipeline reads the restaurant orders from the CSV file.
   Extract and Format: Extracts necessary columns, formatting them into a dictionary for further processing.
   Extract MenuItem and TotalPrice: A custom DoFn function is used to extract the menu item and total price from each order.
   Sum by MenuItem: The total sales for each menu item are aggregated.
   Output: menu_item_sales
   The output consists of text files containing the aggregated results, where each record represents:

   MenuItem: The name of the menu item.
   TotalSales: The total sales for that menu item, calculated as the sum of the TotalPrice for each occurrence of the menu item in the orders.
   The output provides a summarized view of the total sales for each menu item, allowing for an analysis of the restaurantâ€™s sales performance per menu item.

4. Apache Beam : Windowing : Input Dataset: water_consumption.csv
   Apache Beam Pipeline: Windowing Transformation
   The Apache Beam pipeline performs a windowing transformation to process the input dataset. The transformation involves the following steps:

   Read from CSV: Reading water consumption records from the CSV file.
   Assign Timestamps: Assigning timestamps to each record based on the Timestamp column.
   Window into Fixed Intervals: Windowing the records into fixed intervals.
   Calculate Average Consumption per Location: Calculating the average water consumption per location within each window, resulting in a (Location, AverageConsumption) pair for each 
   window.

   Output: average_consumption_per_location
   The output consists of text files containing the aggregated results. Each line in the output files represents:

   Location: The location where water consumption is recorded.
   AverageConsumption: The average water consumption in liters for each location within the specified window intervals.
   Description of Transformation
   This pipeline is designed to analyze water consumption patterns over time at different locations. By windowing the data into fixed intervals and calculating the average consumption 
   per location, it provides insights into water usage trends and variations at each location during different periods.
